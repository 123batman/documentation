# Experimental features

Meilisearch periodically introduces new experimental features. Experimental features are not yet ready for production, but offer functionality that might benefit some users.

An experimental feature's API can change significantly and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.

## Configuring experimental features

There are two main ways to activate and deactivate experimental features. Some must be configured at launch with a command-line flag or an environment variable. Others can only be configured with the `/experimental-features` API route.

## Configuring experimental features at launch

Launch Meilisearch using [configuration options](/learn/configuration/instance_options) to activate an experimental feature:

```sh
./meilisearch --experimental-enable-metrics
```

Consult the documentation for the specific features you are interested in to find their respective options. Command-line flags for experimental features are always prefixed with `--experimental`. Environment variables for experimental features are always prefixed with `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL`.

Activating or deactivating experimental features this way requires you to relaunch Meilisearch.

### Configuring experimental features during runtime

[Use the `/experimental-features` API route](/reference/api/experimental) to configure experimental features during runtime:

<CodeSamples id="update_experimental_features_1" />

Activating or deactivating experimental features this way does not require you to relaunch Meilisearch.
