# Experimental features

Meilisearch periodically introduces new experimental features. Experimental features are new features that are not yet ready for production, but which might benefit some users.

Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.

## Configuring experimental features

There are two main ways to activate and deactivate experimental features. Some must be configured at launch with a command-line flag or an environment variable. Others can only be configured with the `/experimental-features` API route.

## Configuring experimental features at launch

To [configure experimental features at launch](/learn/configuration/instance_options), use their when running the Meilisearch binary. Configuration options for experimental features are always prefixed with `--experimental` in the case of command-line flags and `EXPERIMENTAL` for environment variables. Activating or deactivating experimental features this way requires you to interrupt and relaunch Meilisearch.

### Configuring experimental features during runtime

To configure experimental features during runtime, [use the `/experimental-features` API route](/reference/api/experimental). Activating or deactivating experimental features this way does not require you to relaunch Meilisearch.
