# Experimental

The `/experimental-features` route configures Meilisearch's [experimental features](/learn/experimental/overview). All operations in this route are synchronous.

<Capsule intent="danger">
The experimental API route is not compatible with all experimental features. Consult the [experimental feature overview](/learn/experimental/overview) for a compatibility list.

## Experimental features object

```json
{
  "scoreDetails": false,
  "vectorSearch": false
}
```
